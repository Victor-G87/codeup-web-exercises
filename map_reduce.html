    //~ * Map * ~

    //TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

    // let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    //
    // let evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0)
    //
    // console.log(evens);




    //TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

    // let numberAddOneMap = numbers.map(num => num + 1);
    //
    // console.log(numberAddOneMap);

    //TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

    // let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.foreach(function (restaurant){
    //     return restaurant.name;
    // })
    //
    // console.log(nameList);


    //TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

    // let favoriteRestaurants = [
    //     {
    //
    //         name: 'firewok',
    //         yearsOfOpperation: 5
    //     },
    //     {
    //
    //         name: 'thaidee',
    //         yearsOfOpperation: 6
    //     },
    //
    // ];

    // let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurants.filter(restaurant => restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes(name.length === 7))
    // console.log(favoriteRestaurants)


    // let namelessThan8 = favoriteRestaurants.filter(function (){
    //     return restaurant.name.length < 8;
    // })
    //
    // console.log(namelessThan8)



    //TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

    //~ * Filter * ~

    //TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

    //TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

    //TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants


    //TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

    //TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

    //~ * Reduce * ~

    //Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

    let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

    // let sum =numbers.reduce(function (total, num){
    //     return total + num;
    // },0)
    //
    // console.log(sum)


    let sum =numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num,0)

    console.log(sum)

    //TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

       let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"];

    // let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function (object, element ){
    //     object[element] = element.length;
    //     return object;
    // },{})
    // console.log(strLengthObj)

    // let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce((object, element) => {
    //     object[element] = element.length;
    //     return object;
    // },{})
    // console.log(strLengthObj)


    //TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.





    //TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



    //TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

    let myData = [{
        name: "Thurston Howell III",
        age: 50
    },{
        name: "William Dean Howells",
        age: 83
    },{
        name: "Fievel Howell",
        age: 7
    }]

    // console.log(myData);

    let mySum = myData.reduce(function (total, familyMember){
        return total = familyMember.age;
    },0)
console.log(mySum)
    // let mySum = myData.reduce(function (object, element ){
    //     object[element] = element.length;
    //     return age;
    // },{})
    // console.log(newOne)
